    context: "The largest customer complaint for C3 was stale contact data. Investigation revealed a 30-40% data drop-off caused by a brittle chain of legacy ETL pipelines.",
    goals: ["Eliminate the 30-40% data drop-off", "Bypass legacy pipelines rather than patching them", "Restore customer trust in data freshness"],
    approach: "Proposed and led 'Bellwether', an architectural bypass that integrated C3 directly with GPOD (the upstream source of truth). Chose this direct integration approach to eliminate systemic 'black box' ETL failures and establish a transparent, manageable data path.",
    results: "Delivered a 100% reduction in stale-contact complaints tied to that pipeline, effectively neutralizing the platform's biggest product-driven churn driver.",
    learnings: ["A simpler, transparent solution is far better than relying on a complex pipeline no one can explain.", "Signal de-noising and data freshness are often architectural issues, not feature gaps."]

    tags: ["Platform Sunset", "Cross-Functional", "Revenue Protection"],
    liveUrl: "",
    context: "The business strategy required moving customers off the legacy C3 platform, but a previous forced migration attempt had caused severe churn and reputational damage.",
    goals: ["Protect revenue by making migrations voluntary and value-driven", "Ensure no customer lost a critical workflow during transition", "Execute a phased rollout starting with low-complexity accounts"],
    approach: "Chose a phased tooling strategy (Database-only → Monitoring → Data Groups) to manage operational risk. Partnered with engineering to ensure feature parity on the destination platform before moving accounts, prioritizing 'critical save' accounts to protect high-revenue logos.",
    results: "Successfully transitioned roughly 700 accounts in a controlled, non-disruptive way, protecting revenue during a multi-year legacy period.",
    learnings: ["Migration tooling is a first-class product.", "Migrations must be aligned with customer value and retention, not just platform decommissioning."]

    approach: "Engineered a local React application backed by SQLite. Chose SQLite for local-first data persistence to ensure absolute user privacy in a zero-knowledge environment. Systematized the workflow into a 6-stage pipeline to handle firehose ingestion with deterministic blocklists before AI evaluation.",
    results: "Replaced manual spreadsheeting with a fully automated local job sanctuary. The scout strips away thousands of irrelevant roles instantly using deterministic gate filters.",
    learnings: ["Deterministic gate filtering vastly outperforms AI evaluation at the top of the funnel.", "Local DB architectures provide incredible speed and privacy for sensitive personal data."]

    title: "Leaflet PDF",
    summary: "A local AI pipeline that transforms raw non-fiction content into structured, designed reading artifacts. Raw notes don't teach, designed documents do.",

    type: "Personal AI Tool",
    image: "/images/leafletpdf.png",
    tags: ["AI Pipeline", "Learning Design", "MCP", "TypeScript"],
    liveUrl: "",
    context: "Most articles and notes fail to stick because they're formatted for writing, not reading. I wanted a tool that would take any piece of content and restructure it using proven learning design patterns (BLUF, jargon translation, facts-to-implications, mental buckets) and output it as a typeset document I could actually read and retain.",
    goals: [
      "Build an end-to-end AI pipeline from raw text to print-ready PDF",
      "Apply structured learning techniques automatically based on content type",
      "Design a visual system that treats reading as a first-class experience",
      "Run entirely on a Claude subscription with no separate API key required"
    ],
    approach: "Designed a multi-stage pipeline: claim extraction → technique selection → structured transformation → validation → Playwright PDF render. The technique selector applies rules-based logic (word count, jargon density, causal language patterns) to decide which sections to generate. The renderer uses a full typographic design system (Archivo Black headings, IBM Plex Mono chrome, Source Serif 4 body) across two themes: Orbital Light and Orbital Night. The MCP server delegates AI inference to the host Claude subscription, eliminating the need for a paid API key.",
    results: "Turned any markdown or text file into a structured, multi-section PDF in under two minutes. The pipeline reliably extracts core claims, selects the right learning formats, and renders them in a consistent visual system across two themes.",
    learnings: [
      "Learning design is a product problem. The format of information determines how well it's retained.",
      "Visual systems compound: a consistent type scale, color token set, and layout rhythm make every output feel intentional rather than generated.",
      "MCP sampling unlocks powerful AI workflows without requiring users to manage separate API credentials."

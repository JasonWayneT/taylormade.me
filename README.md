> Jason Taylor's product management portfolio — case studies, work history, and resume for a systems-minded PM specializing in legacy platform stabilization, data integrity, and migration strategy.

## What This Is

A portfolio site built to give hiring managers and recruiters a fast read on who I am as a PM and what I've shipped. The site leads with the problems I've solved — legacy platform stabilization, complex migrations, data integrity under constraint — and backs each case study with specifics: metrics, constraints, and decisions made.

**What this is not:**
- A generic template portfolio — the content and positioning are specific to my background
- A product you install and use — it's a static site, just browse it

## How This Was Built

The design system was defined first — typography, color tokens, component patterns — then content was written before any component code. Case studies were written as product narratives (problem → approach → outcome → learnings) rather than feature lists. The positioning ("systems-minded PM") was decided based on what's consistently true across all my work, not what sounds most general.

The site is deployed on Vercel with a staging branch for previewing changes before they go live.
